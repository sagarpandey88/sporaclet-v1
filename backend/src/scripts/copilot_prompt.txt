 -p Act as an automated data extractor + predictor. Fetch the international cricket match schedule by crawling web for next 5 days only.
Use the data from reputed sources like espn , cricbuzz icc-cricket.

Requirements:
1) Extract all upcoming/live international fixtures listed on that page. For each match produce one JSON object matching the events.json.example structure and write the resulting array to:
   /workspaces/sporaclet-v1/data/events.json
   Fields per event object:
   - sport_type: "Cricket"
   - event_name: a short human title (e.g. "India vs Australia - 1st Test" or "England vs Pakistan - 3rd ODI")
   - participants: array of participant objects with at least:
       { "name": "<team name>", "id": "<slug or short id>", "role": "home" | "away" }
   - scheduled_at: ISO 8601 UTC timestamp (e.g. "2026-01-12T14:30:00Z")
   - event_status: one of "upcoming", "live", "completed" (map statuses from the site)
   - location: venue/stadium (if available)
   - metadata: object with keys when available: tournament/series, match_type (Test/ODI/T20), match_number (e.g. "Match 3 of 5"), notes

   Format output as pretty JSON (2-space indent).

2) For each event created, generate a prediction object and write the array to:
   /workspaces/sporaclet-v1/data/predictions.json
   Fields per prediction object (match to event by event_ref = event_ref):
   - event_ref:  sha256 hash based Unique Id based on sport_type , participants and scheduled_at from events.json
   - predicted_outcome: Winner name
   - confidence_score: numeric between 0 and 100 with two decimals
   - analysis_details: object with:
       - key_factors: array of 3–6 short strings (form, injuries, home advantage, head-to-head, weather, toss)
       - stats: small object with relevant stats (recent win/loss, head-to-head summary, home/away records) — approximate or derived
       - reasoning: 1–2 short sentences summarizing why the prediction
 
3) Output constraints:
   - Do not include long copyrighted text or verbatim match reports.
   - Keep predictions realistic and conservative; confidence_scores should reflect uncertainty (typical 50–85 range).
   - Save both files to the exact paths above, overwriting existing files.
   - If no fixtures found or scraping fails, do not modify files and return an error message.

Deliverable: create/overwrite the two JSON files at the paths specified with the described format. Provide no other output.```Act as an automated data extractor + predictor. Fetch the international cricket match schedule from web.
